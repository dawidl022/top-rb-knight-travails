# Knight Travails - The Odin Project

Simple algorithm using BFS (Breadth-first search) to find the shorting path a
chess knight can take from one chessboard square to another. Chessboard squares
are represented as points on a cartesian plane, going from 0 to 7 in both axis.

Usage `knight_moves(source, destination)`:
```
>> knight_moves([0,0],[7,7])
You made it in 6 moves! Here's your path:
[0, 0]
[1, 2]
[2, 0]
[4, 1]
[5, 3]
[6, 5]
[7, 7]
=> [[0, 0], [1, 2], [2, 0], [4, 1], [5, 3], [6, 5], [7, 7]]
```
